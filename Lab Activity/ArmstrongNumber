1. Write a program to find whether a number is Armstrong
or not.
An Armstrong number is a positive m-digit number 
that is equal to the sum of the mth powers of their 
digits.



package JAVA;

public class ArmstrongNumber {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		

					int number = 371, originalNumber, remainder, result = 0;

	        originalNumber = number;

	        while (originalNumber != 0)
	        {
	            remainder = originalNumber % 10;
	            result += Math.pow(remainder, 3);
	            originalNumber /= 10;
	        }

	        if(result == number)
	            System.out.println(number + " is an Armstrong number.");
	        else
	            System.out.println(number + " is not an Armstrong number.");
	    }
	}
